    """Gloobenoon Services Inc is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
The MostlyRx app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide Gloobenoon Service Inc. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the MostlyRx app won’t work properly or at all.
Gloobenoon Services Inc cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Gloobenoon Services Inc cannot accept responsibility.
At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is available for both Android and iOS– the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. It is your responsibility to keep the app version up to date. Gloobenoon Services Inc does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android or iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, we may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. 
We strongly recommend that you only download the MostlyRx applications from Play Store and App Store. Doing so will ensure that your apps are legitimate and safe from malicious software.
